<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>download the wheel from ___, then do:</p>

        pip install <full filepath to downloaded wheel>


<h2>Using the package</h2>
<p>Depending on the input format of your data and the required output columns, the example scripts may be directly used to annotate input files with different types of information, as required. Otherwise, the example scripts demonstrate how to call various functions of the annotations module in order to add the different types of information to your input files, and can be used as a basis for generating short annotation scripts specific to other use cases.</p>

<h2>Other information</h2>
<p>annotate/ref_files contains the reference files required for annotation</p>
<p>annotate/annotate.py contains the annotation modules</p>
